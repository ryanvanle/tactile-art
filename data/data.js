The bodies are simple and fluid, with no interior details, almost like soft, playful shapes. Their movements are free and unrestrained, evoking a sense of joy and spontaneity. The vibrant colors and bold forms emphasize the emotion of the piece, where form and content harmonize to express pure, unencumbered joy.",
    description: `Matisse created Dance (I) as a study for a painting commissioned by the Russian businessman and arts patron Sergei Shchukin. The final work and its pendant painting, Music (both completed in 1910), are housed in the collection of the Hermitage Museum in St. Petersburg. Dance (I) marks a moment in Matisse’s career when he embraced a reductive approach to painting, seeking the expressive potentials of fundamental elements: line, color, and form.

This daring approach was influenced by the increasing sophistication of photographic technology. In 1909 the artist observed, “The painter no longer has to preoccupy himself with details. The photograph is there to render the multitude of details a hundred times better and more quickly. Plastic form will present emotion as directly as possible and by the simplest means.” Across this monumental canvas Matisse used only four naturalistic colors: blue for the sky, green for the ground, and black and pale pink in rendering the five figures. Although he made adjustments to the composition, Matisse’s final lines convey a remarkable fluidity and sense of dynamic movement in their economical application—in the sweeping curve along the front side of the left figure, for example, and along the outstretched arms of the dancers as they come together in an unhampered expression of joy.`,

Their faces are simplified and sharp-edged, influenced by African masks. The women emerge from broken, geometric curtains, thrusting forward in a flat, two-dimensional space. Their bold eyes meet the viewer’s gaze, while a small arrangement of fruit rests near their feet, mirroring the sharpness of their forms.",
    description: `Among Picasso’s profuse output of more than 20,000 paintings, prints, drawings, sculptures, ceramics, theater sets, and costume designs is Les Demoiselles d’Avignon (1907). In this painting, he did away with pre-existing artistic conventions, like naturalism and perspective, hurling even the most forward-thinking viewers into a future they weren’t quite ready for.

Picasso was a 25-year-old Spanish immigrant to France when he painted Les Demoiselles d’Avignon, working in a cramped warren of studios on the Parisian hill of Montmartre. The story of its making begins with hundreds of preparatory paintings and drawings, which he generated over an intensive six-month period, working out his ideas. They reflected Picasso’s responses to Paul Cézanne’s structured, almost sculptural depiction of objects and figures and his prismatic structuring of space in his still lifes and scenes of bathers. They also reflected his fascination with the African, Iberian, and Oceanic masks and statuary populating France’s ethnographic museums, as well as the lusts and anxieties wrapped up in his own, complex relationships with women.

Out of this intellectual-emotional tumult came a painting in which form and content were equalized. Its title, which translates to “The Young Women of Avignon,” refers to Avignon Street in Barcelona, home to the prostitutes the artist frequented. The five women’s pinkish-peach-colored bodies, appearing larger than human-scale, fill the space of the painting, which is eight feet high by just over seven feet wide. The women’s shoulders, hips, and limbs are depicted with angular lines and flat, geometric planes. Cubic shapes or, in the case of the woman standing left of center, half-circles, form their breasts. Their faces, too, are sharp-edged and radically simplified, especially those of the two women at right, which he modeled directly after African masks.

As his preparatory studies reveal, Picasso initially conceived of the figure at the left of the painting as a male medical student, in the act of entering the brothel. Deciding that such a narrative detail would interfere with the work’s visual impact, he ultimately transformed the figure into a fifth prostitute. The women emerge from brown, white, and blue curtains that look like shattered glass, their bodies thrust forward toward the viewer by the scene’s lack of depth. Their eyes—enormous and almond-shaped, and inspired by African and Iberian carvings—are fixed daringly on the viewer. Near their feet sits a small arrangement of fruit, with a scythe-like sliver of melon set behind a bunch of grapes, an apple, and a pear, and which, like the women’s bodies, seems too sharp to touch.`,

    description: `In creating this image of the night sky—dominated by the bright moon at right and Venus at center left—van Gogh heralded modern painting’s new embrace of mood, expression, symbol, and sentiment. Inspired by the view from his window at the Saint-Paul-de-Mausole asylum in Saint-Rémy, in southern France, where the artist spent twelve months in 1889–90 seeking reprieve from his mental illnesses, The Starry Night (made in mid-June) is both an exercise in observation and a clear departure from it. The vision took place at night, yet the painting, among hundreds of artworks van Gogh made that year, was created in several sessions during the day, under entirely different atmospheric conditions. The picturesque village nestled below the hills was based on other views—it could not be seen from his window—and the cypress at left appears much closer than it was. And although certain features of the sky have been reconstructed as observed, the artist altered celestial shapes and added a sense of glow.

Van Gogh assigned an emotional language to night and nature that took them far from their actual appearances. Dominated by vivid blues and yellows applied with gestural verve and immediacy, The Starry Night also demonstrates how inseparable van Gogh’s vision was from the new procedures of painting he had devised, in which color and paint describe a world outside the artwork even as they telegraph their own status as, merely, color and paint.`,

    alt: "Shooting Painting American Embassy by Niki de Saint-Phalle. This artwork features a chaotic mix of plaster, wire, and scavenged objects like a plastic toy gun, a bucket seat, and an old shoe. The upper section holds plastic paint packages embedded in the messy surface. These packages were shot with a rifle, causing bright, dripping paint to cascade down, creating an explosive and dynamic effect. The vibrant streaks contrast with the cluttered, textured base, turning the act of painting into a charged physical performance.",

    description: `De Saint-Phalle was the only female member of a French group known as the Nouveaux Réalistes, or the New Realists. And these artists were interested in finding new ways, as Robert Rauschenberg famously put it, of “working in the gap between art and life.” They did so by recycling things scavenged from the street or from the garbage can and introducing them into their art. If you look at the lower portion, there are all sorts of scavenged objects a bucket seat and a plastic toy gun, a hatchet, and an old shoe.

If you look at its upper section, I hope you can see that embedded in that messy layer of plaster and wire are plastic packages of paint. And de Saint-Phalle burst many of these packages by shooting at them with a rifle, causing those cascades of brightly colored paint to pour down over the cluttered surface of this work. Her stated goal was "to make a painting that would bleed." In doing this, she repositioned the art of painting and of assemblage into a highly charged physical performance.`,

    alt: "Campbell Soup Cans by Andy Warhol. This iconic series shows 32 soup cans, each painted in red, white, and gold with a clean, graphic design. The front-facing cans feature labels with bold, cursive 'Campbell’s' in white and 'condensed' in smaller letters, all framed by a row of gold fleurs-de-lis. The flavor, such as Chicken Noodle or Clam Chowder, is displayed in red block letters. Though they appear mass-produced, each painting reveals slight irregularities, with hand-applied details like the imperfect spacing of the fleurs-de-lis. The Cheddar Cheese can stands out with two bright yellow banners advertising its versatility.",

    description: `Andy Warhol famously appropriated familiar images from consumer culture and mass media, among them celebrity and tabloid news photographs, comic strips, and, in this work, the widely consumed canned soup made by the Campbell’s Soup Company. When he first exhibited Campbell’s Soup Cans in 1962, the canvases were displayed together on shelves, like products in a grocery aisle. At the time, Campbell’s sold 32 soup varieties; each one of Warhol’s 32 canvases corresponds to a different flavor. (The first flavor the company introduced, in 1897, was tomato).

Though Campbell’s Soup Cans resembles the mass-produced, printed advertisements by which Warhol was inspired, its canvases are hand-painted, and the fleur de lys pattern ringing each can’s bottom edge is hand-stamped. Warhol mimicked the repetition and uniformity of advertising by carefully reproducing the same image across each individual canvas. He varied only the label on the front of each can, distinguishing them by their variety. Warhol said of Campbell’s soup, “I used to drink it. I used to have the same lunch every day, for 20 years, I guess, the same thing over and over again.”

Towards the end of 1962, shortly after he completed Campbell’s Soup Cans, Warhol turned to the photo-silkscreen process. A printmaking technique originally invented for commercial use, it would become his signature medium and link his art making methods more closely to those of advertisements. “I don’t think art should be only for the select few,” he claimed, “I think it should be for the mass of the American people.”`,

    description: `Trained as a painter in Baroda, India, Mukherjee began using natural fibers in the early 1970s, exploring “an integrated approach” fusing local craft with contemporary sculpture. The work’s title references the fertility deity Yakshi from Hindu, Buddhist, and Jain faiths. Mukherjee filtered traditional images of Yakshi into a unique visual mythology that does not refer to existing iconography. While the suggestion of the body's curves evokes a humanlike deity, Yakshi remains abstract. As Mukherjee has said, the figure makes “metaphorical intrusions into other forms.”`,

Her maternal grandparents, of mixed Indigenous and Spanish descent, are superimposed above the Mexican mountain ranges, while her German paternal grandparents float over the Atlantic Ocean. Kahlo paintedthis work a year after Nazi Germany enforced the Nuremberg Race Laws, effectively stripping Jewish peoples of their civil rights and prohibiting interracial marriage—falsely substantiated by a genealogical chart that determined who was Jewish according to bloodlines. Kahlo’s interpretation of a family tree is a counter to such violent, supremacist ideas.`,

Here, faces look in different directions but share a heart, a flower blooms from the beak of a bird, an arm turns into a rose, and a loose pool of color sweeps up into an orange fish. Mediating between dream and reality, Jackson conjures a mystical environment where human and nonhuman entities meet.`,

Ancient Yoruba artists made heads in bronze and terracotta that were part of complete figures or, like here, freestanding.
